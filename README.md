# Training-Neural-Network-
Digit Classification using neural network
Author - ANUJ ATTRI
# Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a neural network model that can accurately classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9, a type of deep learning architecture that is particularly effective for image classification tasks.
# Requirements
1.Python 3
2.TensorFlow
3.Keras
4.NumPy
5.Matplotlib (for visualization)
After training the model on the MNIST dataset, the model achieves an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test set.The TensorFlow and Keras libraries for providing powerful tools for deep learning.
The creators of the MNIST dataset for providing a valuable resource for benchmarking machine learning models.
